# Problem Statement

People with diverse personalities come from a variety of fields and backgrounds. In the
same way, their resume writing style varies. They've worked on a variety of projects, and
each of them has unique writing style. As a result, each resume is unique.
Some people work in the human resources department. They will have to go through
hundreds of resumes on the internet. Executives summarize the resume, enter specific
information into their database, and then call the applicant for job counselling after obtaining
the resume. An executive spent around 10-15 minutes on each resume, summarizing it and
entering the information into the database. This project will help in the automation of this
procedure.
